## Introduction

Fork of [8BitJonny/gh-get-current-pr](https://github.com/8BitJonny/gh-get-current-pr) adopted to Cloud Posse's GitHub Actions standards. 



## Usage



> [!IMPORTANT]
> In Cloud Posse's examples, we avoid pinning GitHub Actions to specific versions to prevent discrepancies between the documentation 
> and the latest released versions. However, for your own projects, we strongly advise pinning each GitHub Action to the exact version
> you're using. This practice ensures the stability of your workflows. Additionally, we recommend implementing a systematic 
> approach for updating versions to avoid unexpected changes.
